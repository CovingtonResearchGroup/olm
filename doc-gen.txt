Some notes on generating documentation.

To generate new documents I used 
sphinx-apidoc -d 2 -F -o <output dir> olm

This will overwrite some existing files.  It is better to manually
keep track of conf.py, index.rst, waterchem.rst, subpackage files
(e.g. waterchem.UGSS.rst), and class files
(e.g. waterchem.general.solution.rst).  However, sphinx-apidoc will
automatically generate new subpackage files and class files, which may
be a useful start.  For the class files, I am inserting the :members:
option right after the autoclass call.

Once you are ready to generate new docs, go into doc directory and "make html"

This generates new html in docs/_build/html/

Currently there seems to be a problem with class method documentation
and sphinx throws some warnings. (This was caused by
numpydoc_show_class_members = True.  Now I've set this to false).

List of doc files to maintain manually:
conf.py
index.rst (this may work without manual editing if I set max depth to 2 when sphinx-apidoc is run?)
olm.rst
olm.USGS.rst
olm.general.solution.rst
