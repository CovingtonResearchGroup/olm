A python package for common water chemistry calculations and automated processing of water quality data. The package is specifically oriented toward common carbonate equilibrium chemistry calculations and calculation of calcite dissolution rates. It is possible to process data from a variety of sources, including time series data from data loggers. However, a variety of functions have already been incorporated that allow automated retrieval of USGS water quality data that meet specified criteria. These data can also be automatically run through speciation calculations using PHREEQC. Additional analysis and plotting functions are currently being developed.
